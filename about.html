        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        <h3>Joshua Daniel Knoechelman</h3>
        <p>
            Joshua Daniel Knoechelman is an independent researcher based in Sarasota, Florida, and the creator of the Resonant Dark Universe (RDU) theory. Originally from Louisville, Kentucky, he supports his research through his full-time work, dedicating his free time to developing a new and comprehensive model of our cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a diverse and interdisciplinary background that spans computer science, music, and martial arts, Joshua brings a unique and multifaceted perspective to the sciences. Following his high school education, he embarked on a non-traditional path, choosing to pursue his passion for physics and cosmology through a rigorous and sustained course of self-study rather than formal academia.
        </p>
        <p>
            Driven by a profound personal mission to master the subjects that fascinated him, he independently delved into the complexities of general physics, quantum mechanics, and cosmology. Overcoming personal challenges, including a learning disability in reading and language, he systematically taught himself the foundational principles required to tackle some of the deepest questions in modern physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Resonant Dark Universe model is the culmination of this dedicated, independent research. It represents years of work spent synthesizing ideas, running simulations, and developing a first-principles framework to unify the quantum and cosmological scales. Through this website, Joshua aims to share his work, invite scrutiny, and collaborate with the broader scientific community.
