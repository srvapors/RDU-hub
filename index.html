        <h2>A Unified Theory of Everything</h2>
        <p>The Resonant Dark Universe (RDU) is a comprehensive cosmological framework designed to resolve the most profound challenges in modern physics from first principles. It is built on a "no-time" philosophy, proposing that reality is a discrete sequence of quantum states governed by a single, unified scalar entity: the Chronos Field (<img src="/RDU-hub/images/Chronos-symbol-1.svg" alt="Chronos Symbol" class="inline-symbol">).</p>
        <p>From the dynamics of this single field, the RDU demonstrates that the entire Standard Model of particle physics can emerge as stable, resonant excitations (solitons). Through numerical simulation, the RDU has derived the masses of all 12 fundamental fermions with remarkable accuracy, reinterpreting the Higgs boson as a fundamental excitation of the field itself and rendering a separate Higgs mechanism unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Beyond the quantum scale, the Chronos Field also drives the universe's complete expansion history, unifying the roles of the Inflaton and dark energy and providing a physical origin for the dark sector. By unifying cosmology and particle physics within a single, self-consistent, and falsifiable framework, the RDU stands as a candidate for a complete Theory of Everything.</p>
