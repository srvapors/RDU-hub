        <h2>The Core Hypothesis: Particles as Field Excitations</h2>
        <p>The RDU proposes that the Standard Model is not a separate entity but is an emergent consequence of the Chronos Field's dynamics. All fundamental particles are hypothesized to be stable, resonant, standing-wave excitations (solitons) of this single field. The specific family and mass of a particle are determined by which interaction mode of the field is excited.</p>

        <h2>Mass Generation: The Resonant Coupling Model</h2>
        <p>Particle mass generation in the RDU is a first-principles mechanism that renders the Standard Model's separate Higgs field redundant. Mass is not an inherent property but is the energy of a stable, resonant excitation of the Chronos Field. The energy for this excitation is drawn from the field's cosmological potential, but the final observed mass is determined by the <strong>RDU Coupling Constants (κ)</strong>. These constants act as amplifiers that scale the effective potential a specific particle "feels," boosting a tiny "bare" mass to the observed particle masses.</p>

        <h2>Deriving the Fermions (Matter)</h2>
        <h3>The Leptons</h3>
        <p>The six fundamental leptons were successfully derived as the stable harmonics of the Chronos Field's electromagnetic mode. The electron was identified as the ground-state soliton (0.511 MeV), with the muon (105.8 MeV) and tau (1779 MeV) as the first and second stable harmonics, respectively. The three neutrinos were found to be the lowest-possible energy excitations of this same mode.</p>
        <h3>The Quarks & Hadrons</h3>
        <p>The six quarks were derived as stable harmonics of the Chronos Field's strong force mode, which required modeling a linear confinement potential. Using this model, stable baryons were constructed. A simulation of two Up quarks and one Down quark (uud) settled into a stable bound state with a mass of 938.5 MeV (the proton), and a simulation of one Up and two Down quarks (udd) stabilized at 939.8 MeV (the neutron). This correctly demonstrated that the majority of a hadron's mass arises from the binding energy of the confinement field.</p>

        <h2>Deriving the Bosons (Force)</h2>
        <p>In the RDU framework, force-carrying bosons are transient, propagating waves that travel between the stable fermion solitons. The photon was derived as a massless, propagating ripple, while the massive W boson (80.5 GeV) and Z boson (91.3 GeV) were derived as transient waves generated during quark transformations. The gluon is identified not as a freely propagating particle but as the confinement field itself—the "flux tube" of stressed Chronos Field between quarks. Finally, a simulation of two orbiting Dark Resonator Cores generated waves with the unique quadrupolar polarization of a spin-2 field, confirming the derivation of the graviton.</p>

        <h2>Summary of Mass Predictions</h2>
        <p>The quantitative accuracy of the RDU's mass predictions is a crucial validation of the theory. The table below compares the derived masses from RDU simulations against their experimentally observed values.</p>
