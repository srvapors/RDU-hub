        <h2>What Really Happens Inside a Black Hole?</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Posted on August 23, 2025</p>
        <p>Black holes have always been a place of deep mystery and wonder. We know things fall in, but the story usually ends there in a paradox. My theory, the Resonant Dark Universe (RDU), tries to shed some light on this subject by proposing what actually happens inside, especially when you realize that time isn't a factor.</p>
        <p>Inside what I call a Dark Resonator Core (DRC), matter falls in like normal. It gets compressed, just like you've always heard, but this is where things get interesting.</p>
        <p>Because of the Chronos Field—the fundamental field that I propose makes up all of reality—we can now see what happens very clearly. The particles of matter get squished into new, tiny, super-energized versions of what they once were. This transformation forces them to do something incredible: they become <strong>superluminal</strong>, meaning they can never travel slower than the speed of light.</p>
        <p>And these new, superluminal particles, which I call <strong>Aumons</strong>, are the very things scientists have been searching for. They are created in two predictable categories that make up the "dark side" of the universe: the ones that clump together are <strong>dark matter</strong>, and the ones that spread out are <strong>dark energy</strong>.</p>
        <p>So, in the RDU, black holes aren't just cosmic vacuum cleaners. They are cosmic factories, actively recycling the matter we can see into the dark matter and dark energy that shape our entire universe.</p>
