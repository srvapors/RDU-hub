        <h2>Why You Don't Need Time to Kick a Ball</h2>
        <p class="post-date">Posted on August 23, 2025</p>
        <p>A common hurdle in understanding the Resonant Dark Universe is its foundational claim that time, as a dimension, doesn't exist. This sounds counter-intuitive. How can anything happen without time? How can a ball move if there's no time for it to travel in?</p>
        <p>The answer is simpler than you'd think. You don't need time to exist to be able to kick a ball and have it move. Things just move. Causality—the fact that the kick causes the ball to be in a new position—is fundamental. "Time" is just our perception of that sequence of events.</p>
        <p>A better way to think about it is to move from time-based math to a state-based system. Imagine a VHS tape. A series of still frames, when played in order, creates the moving video we are used to interacting with. The RDU proposes that the universe works the same way. Reality is a sequence of discrete, holistic "frames" or "states." The laws of physics, governed by the Chronos Field, are the rules that determine how one frame leads to the next.</p>
        <p>The "arrow of time" is simply our experience of moving through this irreversible sequence of frames, from cause to effect. The motion is real, the causality is real, but the "time" they happen in is just an emergent illusion based on the sequence.</p>
